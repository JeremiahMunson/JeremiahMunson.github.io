                <h2>Canopy Near-Infrared Observing Project (CaNOP) CubeSat</h2>

        <p>The Canopy Near-infrared Observing Project (CaNOP) is a CubeSat project at Carthage College funded through the Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium (WSGC) by NASA's Undergraduate Student Instrument Project (USIP). The CaNOP CubeSat will utilize a multispectral pushbroom imager in a 3U CubeSat to carry out spectrally resolved imaging of global forest regions with spectral resolution sufficient to reproduce the <a href="https://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat 8</a> mission. The LandSat 9 is about the size of a telephone booth and costs about $650,000,000. The CaNOP CubeSat is a little bit smaller than a loaf of bread and costs under $250,000. The Landsat satellites are used for a variety of applications including agriculture, resource managment, water and coastal studies, and disaster relief and analysis. Each Landsat covers the entire Earth in 16 days. Currently there are only two in orbit, but if a CubeSat can perform with similar capabilities for a much lower cost there could 16 of these CubeSats allowing for total coverage of the Earth every 24 hours and still cost dramatically less than a single Landsat mission. </p>
        <p>From the multispectral images the team will be capable of indirectly calculating the carbon intake of a forest and to what degree it is a carbon sink or carbon source. This can be used to determine if secondary forests (timber harvested and replanted) are less of a carbon sink than old growth forests (old forest without significant disturbance). If a secondary forest is less of a carbon sink than old growth forests this would imply that logging a forest and replanting trees is not the same as leaving the forest untouched and is more detrimental to the planet.</p>
        <p>The primary goal of the project is to provide an educational experience for undergraduate students by designing, building, testing, and operating a 3U CubeSat. I helped start the project about a month into college and I have learned a lot from the project. I began as the GPS team lead and was named the <a href="./experience.html#systems-engineer">Systems Engineer</a> within a year. I have been fortunate enough to attend and present at multiple conferences and workshops through the project including the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) Conference and the CubeSat Developers Workshop. I've learned a lot about satellite and mission design, leadership, and networking because of the project and I know others have had invaluable experiences of their own working on the CaNOP CubeSat.</p>

                <h2>CubeSat Power Simulations</h2>
                <h3>August 2016 - Present</h3>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>I began developing power simulations for the CaNOP CubeSat mission using Systems Tool Kit (STK) to get a spreadsheet of the power from the solar panels. I began writing a program to go through each line of the spreadsheet to determine which components would be powered on, the power draw, and the available battery power. This initial program was written in C++. As mission operations changed I found it was easier to rewrite power simulations. The new simulations were written in python and I decided to make power simulations that could be easily adjusted for different missions. Essentially, I am trying to make power simulation software that can be used for low earth orbit (LEO) CubeSat missions with preferably no (or at least minimal) adjustments to the code.</p>
        <p>This is still pretty early in development because I have been focusing on completing necessary work for the CaNOP CubeSat mission.</p>

                <h2>Nano-Enhanced Battery: High Altitude Balloon Testing and CubeSat Design</h2>
                <h3>June 2018 - August 2018</h3>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>As technology gets faster, stronger, and smaller, CubeSats are becoming capable of much more powerful missions. CubeSats have strict requirements regarding satellite dimmenstions, mass, and center-of-mass. To provide sufficient power to components without sacrificing crucial mass and volume batteries with higher energy density are required. The Rochester Institute of Technology has developed nano-enhanced batteries, solar panels, and electrical wiring intended for use in space applications, specifically CubeSats.</p>
        <p>From June 4, 2018 to August 10, 2018 I was part of a group of four interns at NASA Glenn Research Center who designed, built, and flew a High Altitude Balloon to cycle the experimental, nano-enhanced battery in "near space" conditions. The experimental battery was cycled at 40 milliamps charge for 10 minutes and 40 milliamps discharge for 10 minutes before repeating. The payload reached an altitude of approximately 112,000 feet. A seperate group of interns was building a communication payload for the High Altitude Balloon to test their communication system. On top of creating a High Altitude Balloon payload and launch the team was tasked with creating a conceptual CubeSat design utilizing the experimental battery, solar panels, and wiring.</p>

                <h2>Magelssen Bluff Trail Accessibility Enhancement</h2>
                <h3>Eagle Scout Project</h3>
            </div>

        <p>In order to become an Eagle Scout one must complete a service project for their school, church, or community. The scout must lead the entire project from start to finish. They must complete a proposal form to be submitted and accepted before the scout may proceed with the project. The scout must then manage the aquisition of all funds and material. The scout is not expected to do the entire project alone, they are expected to have help from friends, family, and the troop. This ensures the scout has experience managing a group of people to complete a project. It teaches young adults how to be a leader and to acquire skills in project management.</p>
        <p>When I was a scout thinking about my future project I was on in Cross Country and ran on many trails and paths. There was one trail that scaled <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Magelssen-Bluff-Park/105559389501301" target="_blank">Magelssen Bluff</a> within the city limits of Rushford, MN. The bluff and the trails are beautiful but the trail was very difficult for many people. One trail is about 0.7 miles going almost straight up the bluff and then walking around the top to the scenic overlook. The other trail is similar only 0.6 miles. People also had a hard time navigating the trails because there was no way to tell which path you were on unless you'd been on the trails a lot. My Eagle Scout project was strategically placing 5 benches and 17 trail signs on the trails scaling Magelssen Bluff. I went door to door to local businesses asking for donations and after receiving sufficient funds bought the materials required for the project. I had friends from my cross country team help me build and place all 5 benches over 2 weekends. After having someone engrave the trail signs we painted in the letters and after drying placed those to help people navigate the trails.</p>
        <p>One of the craziest things about this project has been the feedback. About a day or two after I had officially finished the project my dad and I were placing mulch around one of the signs when a man walked over and asked if we were the ones who placed the benches and signs. My dad told him it was for my Eagle Scout project and the man shook my hand and thanked me. When he saw the signs and benches he told himself if he ever met the people responsible he would have to thank them. I've seen posts on facebook of people using the benches and signs and being thankful for them. I've also seen people using the benches while hiking and it always makes me feel good seeing people enjoying it. My scoutmaster has also been thanked by people in the community. He said people who couldn't hike the trails before because they were too hard are now able to because they have a place to stop and rest. It was crazy to think an idea I first had when I was around 14 or 15 could make such an impact on the community.</p>

        <p>I have been developing this personal website for a long time and will continue to update it. I began by teaching myself HTML and CSS and made a simple personal website that way. In January 2019 I took a class on Web Development and learned to use bootstrap which I used to make this website you are looking at right now.</p>

                <h2>Pangram Decoder</h2>
                <h3>November 2018</h3>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>When a group of people have a secret code, one concern is that someone will forget part of the code. How often does the average person use the letters j, x, q, and z? You don't want to simply write the code out as the alphabet because then anyone who finds it knows your code. Instead someone can write a pangram in their code. A pangram is a phrase that uses every letter in the english alphabet. Because of this if someone writes a pangram using their code and then they can use this as a reference to know any letter they had forgotten but no one else would understand what it means because they would need to know the pangram. For example, if your code is reversing the alphabet so a becomes z and z becomes a, b becomes y and y becomes b, etc. the pangram "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" becomes "Gsv jfrxp yildm ulc qfnkh levi gsv ozab wlt."</p>
        <p>I thought about how easy it is to decode if you know the pangram which is the point to using them. But if someone else could figure out what the pangram was they could also decode it. I also thought about how difficult it is to come up with a short, memorable pangram and the best ones are probably already online. So I made a program in ruby where the user inputs a coded pangram (must use a-z with no numbers currently). It compares the coded pangram with over 200 different pangrams from online and determines which pangram was used if it is in the list of pangrams and decodes it. I wrote the program in ruby because when I started I felt there wasn't much benefit to doing it in ruby vs python but I wanted more experience in ruby which I felt I got. The program is in <a href="https://github.com/JeremiahMunson/Pangram-Decoder" target="_blank">this</a> github repository. I also used this project to get more experience with git and github.</p>

            <img src="PeekAWho.png" width=100px height=50px alt="PeekAWho Logo">
        </div>

        <p>PeekAWho is a project I conceived as a hackathon project. When my friend Joe and I went to a 12 hour hackathon (MadhacksMini) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison we decided it would be the perfect project. This also explains the name and logo, we'd been programming for about 10-11 hours straight and realized we hadn't given the project a name or logo.</p>
        <p>PeekAWho is intended to be a small device one places on their door. There will be a small camera that must be placed at the peephole for the door. The camera has a live feed out the peephole streamed to an app on the person's phone. If someone stops by the door PeekAWho uses facial recognition to determine who it is or if it is an unknown person. It then sends a message to the user with who was at the door and when they were there. If PeekAWho doesn't know who the person was it will send a snapshot of the person and the user can respond with the persons name to save that person in the system. Through the app the PeekAWho system can be set to not notify the user if certain people stop by. For example, the user would probably not want to be notified every time they stop at their door to unlock it or a roommate or significant other.</p>
        <p>PeekAWho is currently in development. The project demoed at the hackathon can be found in <a href="https://github.com/jwons/PeekAWho" target="_blank">this</a> Github repository.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Every year NASA Glenn Research Center holds an Undergraduate Student Design Challenge. The challenge during the 2016-2017 academic school year was designing an environmentally friendly, flying car transportation system. At Carthage College we assembled a team of about four people to work on the challenge. Of the four people on the team three of us were also on the CubeSat which was problematic because the first design review for the challenge was a few days after the CaNOP CubeSat CDR which took priority. We were able to design a conceptual flying car looking at power requirements, propolsion requirements, and safety concerns. We were also able to put together a theoretical layout for a transportation system utilizing the flying car in the Chicago area.</p>
