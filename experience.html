            Production Resource Group (PRG) is an international live entertainment and event technology solution provider. I worked with Research and Development in the Automation Department at the facility in New Windsor, NY that provides automated systems for theatrical productions, concerts, and many other live events.
            The project I spent most of my time working on was swing cancellation. Whenever a piece is hanging by cables or chains and it needs to move the piece will begin to swing. When two hanging pieces approach each other they cannot have any swing, otherwise they will collide. Normally this can be provided by breaking up the acceleration and deceleration phases into impulses.
            The impulses would produce more swing that ends up canceling the previous swing. However, things get more complicated when the cable length is changing so the system resembles a pendulum with changing line length. My goal was to find a way to move the pieces in the required time frame and reach their destination without any residual sway.
            My final result was a simulation written in C++ with a C# interface that simulates many different acceleration, deceleration, and constant velocity times within the required move duration. The simulation would use the final angle of the piece and the angular velocity to determine the amount of sway when the move ends.
            By simulating different moves the program determines what acceleration, deceleration and constant velocity times provide the least amount of sway.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other project I briefly worked on was taking a hanging piece and tilting it. Given the short time to work on this after finishing work on swing cancellation I was only able to work on a piece in 1 dimension like a bar or wall where all of the connections are in a straight line.
            For the piece to be stationary after tilting there needs to be no net force on the piece. This is easy vertically because the tension in the cables counters the force from gravity. The tricky part is the horizontal component of the tension. When a piece is at an angle the piece itself will be shifted over slightly and the cables will not hang straight up and down.
            This means that for a piece to be stationary (in equilibrium) the sum of the horizontal components from the tension of each line must be zero. I wrote a program in C# that takes information on the connections and the desired piece height and tilt angle and determines what the length of each cable must be for the desired height and angle to be at equilibrium.
        </p>
        <p>
            In these simulations I wrote several algorithms used in computational physics. For the swing cancellation project I created and used the Fourth Order Runge-Kutta ordinary differential equation solver (RK4) to simulate the piece during a move. To simulate the changing angular velocity I had to calculate the angular acceleration which I did using classical mechanics with multiple non-inertial reference frames including one rotating reference frame.
            For the coordinated motion project I wrote a multidimensional root-finding algorithm using the Newton-Raphson technique. For this I created a matrix class that was used to store the Jacobian and the inverse of the Jacobian. 
            To calculate the inverse of the Jacobian the program adjoins the Jacobian and the identity matrix and row reduces until the matrix is in row reduced echelon form. The part of the matrix that used to be the Jacobian is now the identity matrix and part that was the identity matrix is now the inverse of the Jacobian.

            I became the Systems Engineer for the Canopy Near-Infrared Observing Project (<a href="./projects.html#canop">CaNOP</a>) CubeSat the summer after my freshman year of college. As the SE I was the student lead for the project. For the first two years that I was the SE, the team averaged about 20 students split into 6-7 different systems. 
            I led full team meetings on a weekly basis in order to update everyone on the overall progress of the current documentation and next steps. Each system also had their own weekly meetings to go over their own system specific updates. 
            I led the completion of the Systems Requirement Review (SRR), Conceptual Design Review (CoDR), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and Critical Design Review (CDR) which were given and usually presented to NASA and the Safety Design Review Phase 0/1 and Safety Design Review Phase 2 for our launch integrator, NanoRacks. 
            I performed mission simulations using Systems Tool Kit (STK) including communications coverage, power availability, and coverage over imaging targets. I learned the basics of NASAâ€™s Debris Assessment Software (DAS) to create preliminary orbital lifetime and debris risk estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
            I attended multiple conferences and workshops to learn about other CubeSat missions and presented on our own CubeSat mission. The following is a list of presentations I have given on the CaNOP CubeSat project:

        <p>My project was designing a conceptual CubeSat to advance the technology readiness level (TRL) of the experimental, nano-enhanced power system developed by the Rochester Institute of Technology. I worked with a team of three other Space Academy Research Associates (RAs) to develop the specific mission goals and requirements. The project also involved designing, building, and launching a High Altitude Balloon (HAB) payload as a proof-of-concept for select parts of the power system before a CubeSat is fully developed. I, with my fellow RAs, created the mission objectives and requirements for the HAB mission. I used the electronics design program Fritzing to help organize the electrical connections between the different components. I did extensive research into the BeagleBone Black microcontroller to ensure it was capable of operating as the primary flight computer for the HAB mission.</p>
	    <p>As an RA with the NASA Space Academy I had requirements outside the standard internship. My fellow RAs and I had mandatory activities designed for team work and leadership. As a group of leaders it is important to learn know when and how to be a leader of leaders and when and how to perhaps take a step back and not intrude on someone else's role. As an RA I also attended at least one presentation by industry innovators and leaders discussing their work and/or how they got to where they are now.</p>

        <p>During the 2016-2017 school year there was an Undergraduate Student Design Challenge hosted by NASA Glenn Research Center. The challenge was to design an environmentally friendly flying car transportation system and ensure easy integration into modern city infrastructure. I was on the team at Carthage College competing in the competition. Initially my responsibilities were focusing on how the flying car would fly including the power requirements necessary. Later when more team members were available to take on more responsibilities I was in charge of leading the research and design of the power system for the project. I did a little research into batteries and their energy densities. I also tried to find different ways to reduce the energy requirements for the flying cars. I researched environmentally friendly power sources to charge the flying cars to ensure we met all requirements for the challenge.</p>

        <p>I was a nanotechnology intern with both Rushford Conductive NanoFiber and Rushford NanoElectroChemistry Company. I researched the properties and applications of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) enhancing my understanding of the material as well as improving my capabilities to find various resources for niche subjects online. I learned the basics of LabView to assist in pulse electrochemical machining at the micrometer level with nanometer precision.
