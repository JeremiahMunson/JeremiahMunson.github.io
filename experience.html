        <p>I became the Systems Engineer for the Canopy Near-Infrared Observing Project (<a href="./projects.html#canop">CaNOP</a>) CubeSat the summer after my freshman year of college. As the SE I am the student lead for the project. For the first two years that I was the SE, the team averaged about 20 students split into 6-7 different systems. I led full team meetings on a weekly basis in order to update everyone on the overall progress of the current documentation and next steps. Each system also had their own weekly meetings to go over their own system specific updates. I led the completion of the Systems Requirement Review (SRR), Conceptual Design Review (CoDR), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and Critical Design Review (CDR) which were given and usually presented to NASA and the Safety Design Review Phase 0/1 and Safety Design Review Phase 2 for our launch integrator, NanoRacks. I have performed mission simulations using Systems Tool Kit (STK) including communications coverage, power availability, and coverage over imaging targets. I learned the basics of NASA’s Debris Assessment Software (DAS) to create preliminary orbital lifetime and debris risk estimates.</p>
        <p>I attended multiple conferences and workshops to learn about other CubeSat missions and presented on our own CubeSat mission. The following is a list of presentations I have given on the CaNOP CubeSat project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CubeSat Developers Workshop - San Luis Obispo, CA: Poster Presentation (April-May 2018)</li>
            <li>Carthage College Celebration of Scholars - Kenosha, WI: Poster Presentation (April 2018)</li>
            <li>American Society for Gravitational and Space Research - Seattle, WA: Poster Presentation (October 2017)</li>
            <li>CubeSat Workshop for Students by Students - McMinneville, OR: Oral Presentation (August 2016)</li>
            <li>Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium Conference - Superior, WI: Poster and Oral Presentations (August 2016)</li>

        <p>My project was designing a conceptual CubeSat to advance the technology readiness level (TRL) of the experimental, nano-enhanced power system developed by the Rochester Institute of Technology. I worked with a team of three other Space Academy Research Associates (RAs) to develop the specific mission goals and requirements. The project also involved designing, building, and launching a High Altitude Balloon (HAB) payload as a proof-of-concept for select parts of the power system before a CubeSat is fully developed. I, with my fellow RAs, created the mission objectives and requirements for the HAB mission. I used the electronics design program Fritzing to help organize the electrical connections between the different components. I did extensive research into the BeagleBone Black microcontroller to ensure it was capable of operating as the primary flight computer for the HAB mission.</p>
	    <p>As an RA with the NASA Space Academy I had requirements outside the standard internship. My fellow RAs and I had mandatory activities designed for team work and leadership. As a group of leaders it is important to learn know when and how to be a leader of leaders and when and how to perhaps take a step back and not intrude on someone else's role. As an RA I also attended at least one presentation by industry innovators and leaders discussing their work and/or how they got to where they are now.</p>

        <p>During the 2016-2017 school year there was an Undergraduate Student Design Challenge hosted by NASA Glenn Research Center. The challenge was to design an environmentally friendly flying car transportation system and ensure easy integration into modern city infrastructure. I was on the team at Carthage College competing in the competition. Initially my responsibilities were focusing on how the flying car would fly including the power requirements necessary. Later when more team members were available to take on more responsibilities I was in charge of leading the research and design of the power system for the project. I did a little research into batteries and their energy densities. I also tried to find different ways to reduce the energy requirements for the flying cars. I researched environmentally friendly power sources to charge the flying cars to ensure we met all requirements for the challenge.</p>

        <p>I was a nanotechnology intern with both Rushford Conductive NanoFiber and Rushford NanoElectroChemistry Company. I researched the properties and applications of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) enhancing my understanding of the material as well as improving my capabilities to find various resources for niche subjects online. I learned the basics of LabView to assist in pulse electrochemical machining at the micrometer level with nanometer precision.
