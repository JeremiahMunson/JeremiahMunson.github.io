        Sigma Pi Sigma is the national physics honors society within the American Institute of Physics (AIP) and is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies. 
        To be considered for induction I had to have a GPA in the major (physics) of 3.0 or better, be in the top third of Carthage students with overall GPA, and have presented original physics research in some physics forum. 
        You can learn more about Sigma Pi Sigma at their <a href="https://www.sigmapisigma.org/sigmapisigma/about" target="_blank">website</a>.

        <p>
        With everything that I'm doing I make sure my grades don't suffer much. It's all about time management and prioritization. Sometimes I can't attend a club meeting to finish homework. 
        But sometimes a homework assignment isn't ideal because I spent my weekend at a hackathon. I know what is important to me and I have been able to balance all of my responsibilities and projects.
        I also know that results don't come easily. If I want good grades while doing amazing things outside the classroom I know it will take a lot of time and hard work and I'm willing to work with that.

    	<p>My friend Joe Wonsil and I won the Security and Privacy category at the MadHacks Mini Hackathon in April 2018. Over the entire 12 hour hackathon we created from scratch a program in Python that used a facial recognition library (<a href="https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition" target="_blank">face_recognition</a>) and sockets to communicate between computers. The demoed project is available on GitHub titled <a href="https://github.com/jwons/PeekAWho" target="_blank">PeekAWho</a>.

        <p>Every year the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Carthage College awards one physics major, usually a sophomore, with the Outstanding Physics Student Award for "exceptional academic achievement by a physics major." I was given the award for the 2016-2017 academic school year when I was a sophomore.</p>

        <p>To achieve the rank of Eagle Scout one must be highly motivated and capable of dedicating themselves to a group for years. There are many specific requirements to achieve the rank but most notably it is required the scout create, plan, lead, and execute a service project bettering his church, school, or community.</p>
		<p>My project was building and placing 5 benches and 17 trail signs along the trails scaling a bluff leading to an overlook with a spectacular view of my hometown. Before the project was done I was being thanked by people I had never met before who loved the trails and used the benches and signs. The project has allowed people who would otherwise not be able to make the steep climb up the bluff enjoy the trails as I did and still do.</p>
