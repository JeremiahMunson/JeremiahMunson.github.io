        <p>With everything that I'm doing I make sure my grades don't suffer much. There are times where my grades aren't as good as they could be when I'm focusing on a project or my fraternity and vice versa. It's all about time management and prioritization. I'd rather go to a Hackathon one weekend and not get an A on the homework assignment for Monday but I still manage to keep it an A- or maybe B+ because I am able to manage my time. I also know that results don't come easily. If I want good grades while doing amazing things outside the classroom I know it will take a lot of time and hard work and I'm willing to work with that. I may not be able to make summa cum laude (U.S. undergraduate: with highest honors) with my grades, but I'd rather get magna cum laude (with great honor) and place at hackathons and build a satellite (although doing all that AND getting summa cum laude is ideal).</p>

    	<p>My friend Joe Wonsil and I won the Security and Privacy category at the MadHacks Mini Hackathon in April 2018. Over the entire 12 hour hackathon we created from scratch a program in Python that used a facial recognition library (<a href="https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition" target="_blank">face_recognition</a>) and sockets to communicate between computers. The demoed project is available on GitHub titled <a href="https://github.com/jwons/PeekAWho" target="_blank">PeekAWho</a>.

        <p>Every year the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Carthage College awards one physics major, usually a sophomore, with the Outstanding Physics Student Award for "exceptional academic achievement by a physics major." I was given the award for the 2016-2017 academic school year when I was a sophomore.</p>

        <p>To achieve the rank of Eagle Scout one must be highly motivated and capable of dedicating themselves to a group for years. There are many specific requirements to achieve the rank but most notably it is required the scout create, plan, lead, and execute a service project bettering his church, school, or community.</p>
		<p>My project was building and placing 5 benches and 17 trail signs along the trails scaling a bluff leading to an overlook with a spectacular view of my hometown. Before the project was done I was being thanked by people I had never met before who loved the trails and used the benches and signs. The project has allowed people who would otherwise not be able to make the steep climb up the bluff enjoy the trails as I did and still do.</p>
