            Sigma Pi Sigma is the national physics honors society within the American Institute of Physics (AIP) and is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies. 
            To be considered for induction I had to have a GPA in the major (physics) of 3.0 or better, be in the top third of Carthage students with overall GPA, and have presented original physics research in some physics forum. 
            You can learn more about Sigma Pi Sigma at their <a href="https://www.sigmapisigma.org/sigmapisigma/about" target="_blank">website</a>.

        </div>
        <p>For my internship in the summer of 2018, I was selected to be a Research Associate (RA) for the 2018 NASA Space Academy at the Glenn Research Center (GRC). My internship was being part of a team of 3 other RAs to develop a <a href="./projects.html#balloon">high altitude balloon experiment</a> to cycle experimental, nano-enhanced batteries to increase their TRL leading to a potential CubeSat mission.</p>
        <p>Like every other intern I was required to work 40 hours/week on my internship designing, building, testing, and flying the balloon experiment. The academy had additional requirements and time commitment I followed for the 10 week internship. I attended weekly meetings to go over the agenda for the upcoming weeks activities for the academy. We also had nearly weekly presentations by NASA employees about their work and/or how they got to where they are today. It was required that each RA introduce at least one speaker throughout the internship. Every week the RAs went out to dinner together at least once and had team-building activities almost every weekend. As part of the academy I got to visit Astrobotic, Carnegie Mellon, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), the Air Force Museum at WPAFB, and GE Aviation. We also took a trip to California to visit Aerojet Rocketdyne, JPL, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, SpaceX, and Virgin Orbit. At the end of the internship in August, I was inducted into the NASA Academy Alumni Association (<a href="https://www.nasa-Academy.org/" target="_blank">NAAA</a>).</p>
        <p>The NASA Academies are designed to develop future leaders in aerospace, both at NASA and in private industry. The academy selects individuals who have already demonstrated a general leadership foundation. The academy trains leaders to lead other leaders. This also means that it teaches natural leaders to sometimes take a step back and not overstep their boundaries. The academy is also set-up to encourage cooperation and communication among RAs to ensure future leaders in aerospace know to communicate and cooperate with one another.

        <p>I was active with the computer science community at Carthage. The semester after taking my first computer science class I attended my first hackathon at UW-Madison with Carthage's CS club. While I didn't demo a project I still loved the experience and have now gone to 4 different hackathons with the CS club. I even won an <a href="./achievements.html#hackathon">award</a> at a hackathon with my friend. Outside of participating in hackathons the CS club held weekly meetings discussing different topics in computer science and have alumni come back or skype to talk about their experiences after graduation and offer advice to students.</p>

        <p>I rushed the Gamma Gamma Chapter of Phi Kappa Sigma in the fall of my sophomore year (Fall 2016). Rushing the fraternity and being an active member has done more for me than I could have imagined. Before joining the fraternity I was incredibly shy and quiet and was uncomfortable socializing with people I didn't already know. That changes very quickly when you're rushing a social fraternity. I soon found that I was a lot more social and outgoing while I was rushing. The fraternity also made me more confident in myself. These personal improvements have also improved my professional life. At national conferences and workshops I am much more comfortable and confident in presenting my research and making connections with members of the industry.</p>
        <p>In the spring 2018 semester I was the Academic Chair, the third highest position in the chapter. I would prepare interesting and relevant information to teach to the Chapter at our weekly meetings. Being in front of approximately 40 people, presenting different information every week, further developed my speaking and general presenting skills. Being an officer in the chapter I had certain documents to provide our fraternity headquarters and had a video call with a headquarters employee to discuss fraternity information.</p>

        <p>The Society of Physics Students (SPS) at Carthage College held meetings every other week. At these meeting we would discuss events in physics such as Nobel Prize winners, the discovery of gravitational waves, and the redefinition of the SI base units. The SPS chapter at Carthage also held trips to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes_Observatory" target="_blank">Yerkes Observatory</a>.</p>

        <p>In October 2017 I attended the annual ASGSR conference to present on the CaNOP CubeSat project. I was one of three students selected from the project to present at ASGSR. We were part of the student poster presentations during the conference.</p>
