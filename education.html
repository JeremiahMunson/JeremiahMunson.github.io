        <h4>Computer Science and Mathematics Minors</h4>
        <p>I love the experiences I've gotten at <a href="https://www.carthage.edu/" target="_blank">Carthage College</a>. Carthage is currently the lead institute for the Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium (<a href="https://spacegrant.carthage.edu/" target="_blank">WSGC</a>). My freshman year of college I was fortunate enough to help start the Canopy Near-Infrared Observing Project (<a href="./projects.html#canop">CaNOP</a>) CubeSat, the WSGC's first CubeSat mission. I have been the Systems Engineer for the CaNOP CubeSat since June 2016. I was also able to participate in a conceptual design competition for a <a href="./projects.html#flying-car">future air vehicle</a>.
        I have had the pleasure of also being involved in the Computer Science department at Carthage College. I joined the Computer Science Club and participated in four hackathons with other Carthage CS students. My friend <a href="https://jwons.github.io/" target="_blank">Joe Wonsil</a> and I won the Security and Privacy category at the Madhacks-Mini for our project <a href="./projects.html#peek-a-who">PeekAWho</a>. This was a 12-hour hackathon hosted by the University of Wisconsin - Madison in spring 2018.
        I also joined the Gamma Gamma Chapter of Phi Kappa Sigma International Fraternity. Joining the fraternity greatly increase my confidence and made me more outgoing, an amazing feat considering how shy I was before. I have noticed a significant improvement in my networking capabilities and confidence presenting at different conferences.
        Through my experiences and the connections I have made at Carthage College I was selected as a <a href="./experience.html#research-associate">Research Associate</a> for the NASA Space Academy at NASA Glenn Research Center for the summer of 2018.</p>
        <p>I have a 3.84 overall GPA on a 4.00 scale with a 3.89 GPA in my major, a 3.89 GPA in my Mathematics minor, and a 4.00 GPA in my Computer Science minor.</p>
